# RPI_video_template
here is a handy template for doing video processing in the PI with openFrameworks and glsl
examples of how to take usb camera input, use framebuffer objects, how to do feedback, how to modify color in the shaders, how to key and mix two textures together, how to do midi input, and some more i think.
works best with the waaave_pool distribution of openFrameworks, download this
and unzip to the apps->myApps folder, open the folder in terminal and type "make" then "make run"
